title: Replacing React
---

We find React to be a proven and battle-tested UI library that gives you access to a huge ecosystem of tools and libraries. That allows us to use tools like react-router, react-query, and many others!

The best part about B2B SaaS Kit setup is that because we are using Astro it allows you to use multiple frameworks [at the same time](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/framework-components/#mixing-frameworks).

In practice, we would recommend your team stick to no more than a couple of frameworks and use them for different pages. For example, your marketing page could be built with Svelte or SolidJS to get fast load times, while your app could be built with React to allow you to move faster using existing solutions.

We do not have plans to support other frameworks, but we would be happy to showcase demos of how to use B2B SaaS Kit with other frameworks.
